Post-WWII, <strong>East Asia (Japan, South Korea) successfully closed the development gap with the West</strong>, unlike most other developing countries. To understand why, I compare East Asia's approach to that of Latin America (Argentina, Brazil) between 1950 and 1990.

I use GDP per capita to measure development.

The analysis reveals that <strong>East Asia's success was built on three core pillars</strong>:

1. <strong>Trade openness</strong>: encouraged global competitiveness.

2. <strong>Strategic state intervention</strong>: prioritised long-term capital formation over short-term consumption.

3. <strong>Monetary discipline</strong>: ensured a stable, low-inflation environment for investment.

Latin America's opposite approach of protectionism, internal consumption, and money-printing culminated in a hyperinflationary crisis at the end of the 1980s.

From the 1990s onwards, <strong>South Korea outgrew Japan</strong> in GDP per capita: Japan's economy plateaued while <strong>South Korea's</strong> continued on a strong growth trajectory.

An analysis of <strong>South Korea's</strong> success revealed a commitment to fiscal discipline and a focus on long-term investment, ensuring continued export dominance. <strong>Japan</strong> plateaued after pivoting to debt-fueled stimulus, which stifled investment and competitiveness.

The <strong>key takeaway</strong> is that sustained economic success requires a disciplined, long-term focus on investment, especially when adapting to crises.
